[SettingsInfo]
Target = Provides a space for you to specify an output file and location of the program that the linker creates.
Working Directory = Provides a space for you to specify the directory in which executing occurs. If you do not specify a directory, executing occurs in the directory where the executable is located.
Command Line Arguments = Provides a space for you to specify command-line arguments you want to pass to the program at startup.
Excluded Files = This will exclude the file(s) included in this UE project group from the build.
Compiler Options = Provides a space for you to specify an additional compiler options.
Word Alignment = Switches on/off word-alignment of variables and typed constants.
Range Checking = Enables and disables the generation of range-checking code.
Objects and Structures Align = Switches on/off word-alignment of objects and structures.
I/O checking = Enables or disables the automatic code generation that checks the result of a call to an I/O procedure.
Open string params = Controls the meaning of variable parameters declared using string keyword.
Overflow checking = Controls the generation of overflow checking code.
Typed pointers = Controls the types of pointer values generated by the @ operator.
Show warnings = Switches on/off warnings generation.
Extended syntax = Enables or disables Turbo Pascal's extended syntax.
Complete Boolean eval = Switches on/off the two different models of code generation for the AND and OR Boolean operators.
Frame optimization = Switches on/off stack frame optimization.
Registers optimization = Switches on/off register optimization.
C/C++ style comments = Switches on/off C/C++ style comments recognition.
Ada-style comments = Switches on/off Ada-style comments recognition.
Intel MMX Assembler = Enables/disables Intel MMX instructions support in built-in assembler.
AMD 3DNow! Assembler = Enables/disables AMD 3DNow! Instructions support in built-in assembler.
Typed Inc/Dec operations = Enables/disables typed Inc/Dec operations on pointers.
Debugger=Provides a space for you to set the debugger you want to use to debug application.
