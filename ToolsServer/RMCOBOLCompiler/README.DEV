          Product Restrictions          ____________________

          The Educational Version of the RM/COBOL-85 product contains the
          following restrictions and changes:

               COBOL source programs may describe no more than 4 files.

               Source programs may define no more than 2 keys in an indexed
               file.

               The described record sizes of files are limited to 132
               characters.

               Source programs may not use segmentation.

               If a program compilation error is diagnosed for one of the
               above Educational Version restrictions, the generated object
               is marked as not executable.

               Programs compiled with the Educational compiler will not run
               on a standard RM/COBOL-85 runtime system and vice versa.

               Both the compiler and the runtime system display an
               additional banner line identifying the product as an
               Educational Version.

               Neither the compiler nor the runtime system support
               configuration files.

               Runtime instrumentation is not supported.

               The COBOL main program always starts in debug mode.

               Only one CALL statement to a separately compiled program may
               be active, but contained programs may be called
               indefinitely.

               The only subprogram provided with runtime is C$RERR.  The
               C$RERR subprogram may be called from the inner separately
               compiled program.

               No more than 4 files may be open concurrently.

               No more than 1000 records may be written to sequential and
               relative organization files; no more than 100 records may be
               written to an indexed organization file.  This also
               restricts the compiler to no more than 1000 source or print
               records.  No more than 100 records may be written to a file
               opened extend.

               No utility or verify programs are provided with the
               Educational Version.


          5.20 Changes          ____________

          In releases before 5.20, the compiler version of the object was
          closely tied to language features such that if an existing
          program did not use any of the features, when compiled it would
          automatically produce object at a version level corresponding to
          the language features that were actually used.  The result of
          this was that a newer compiler could produce object at an object
          version level that older runtimes could execute.  In 5.20,
          however, enhancements were made to commonly used language
          features to improve their performance.  These enhancements can
          not be executed by previous versions of the runtime, thus
          existing programs should not be recompiled with the 5.20 compiler
          unless they can be executed by a 5.20 runtime everywhere, or they
          are compiled with the Z option setting the object version level
          to one that can be accepted by all runcobols.




          5.20 Deficiencies          _________________

          None.


          Documentation Updates          _____________________

          The 5.2 User's Guide and Language Reference manual did not state
          that performing an ACCEPT with a BEFORE TIME value of 0 will
          result in a immediate return if there is no key stroke waiting,
          and that a value greater than 4,294,967,295 (a PIC 9(10) data
          item set to a value of all 9s is recommended) will cause the
          ACCEPT to behave as if it did not contain a BEFORE TIME phrase.

          The 5.2 User's Guide incorrectly states that any value greater
          than 8,639,999 in the BEFORE TIME phrase of the ACCEPT statement
          will be set to 8,639,999.  This is only true of values in the
          range 8,640,000 through 4,294,967,295.  As noted above, a value
          greater than 4,294,967,295 may be used to suppress the timeout of
          the ACCEPT operation normally caused by the presence of the
          BEFORE TIME phrase.



          The RM/COBOL-85 User's Guide for DOS, OS/2 and NetWare, on page
          8-16, states that the default pool size is 65000 for the runtime
          system and 20000 for the compiler.  This is incorrect, it is
          actually 64000 for a DOS runtime system, 20480 for a DOS compiler
          system, and 256000 for the DOS recover1 utility.  Furthermore,
          the User's guide does not state the default for OS/2, which is
          256000 for the runtime system and 20480 for the compiler system.



          The User's Guide, page A-6, replace description of procedure
          errors 208 - 210 with the following clarifications:

               208  The ALTER statement cannot be executed because of an
               error in the source program.  The compilation listing
               provides the specific reason for the error, for example, an
               undefined procedure-name, an ambiguous procedure-name
               reference, an attempt to ALTER a procedure-name that is not
               alterable, a conflict with segmentation rules, et cetera.

               209  The GO TO statement cannot be executed because it does
               not specify a default procedure-name and was not altered
               before attempting its execution.  The source program would
               have a compilation error if no ALTER statement specifies the
               paragraph containing the GO TO statement, but would have
               compiled without error if there exists at least one ALTER
               statement that specifies the paragraph containing the GO TO
               statement.  In the latter case, no such ALTER statement was
               executed in the logical sequence of statements leading to
               execution of the GO TO statement.

               210  The GO TO or PERFORM statement cannot be executed
               because of an error in the source program.  The compilation
               listing provides the specific reason for the error, for
               example, an undefined procedure-name, an ambiguous
               procedure-name reference, a conflict with segmentation
               rules, et cetera.

          The User's Guide, page A-6, add a description of runtime
          procedure error 212:

               212  The USE procedure cannot exit because it was invoked by
               the execution of a SORT or MERGE statement and the sort-
               merge operation is either no longer active or the exit
               location has been lost.

          DOS 5.0 DOSSHELL

          The DOSSHELL program, provided with DOS 5.0, allows the operator
          to switch among several concurrent programs.  If you intend to
          run more than one version of RUNCOBOL under the DOSSHELL, we
          recommend that you install SHARE.EXE before starting the
          DOSSHELL.  Failure to first install SHARE.EXE will cause File
          Status 98 errors when a file is opened by two instances of the
          runtime system.




          Novell NETWARE XMS and EMS Shells

          There is a bug in the Novell Netware XMS and EMS shells, versions
          3.01 A-D.  This bug causes them to return incorrect information
          for the server name when asked to resolve a file name for a file
          that resides on the server.  Novell's recommendation is to use
          the NET3 or NET4 shells instead of the XMS or EMS versions until
          they release the next version of the shell software.  If the
          flawed Netware Shells are used they could cause problems in the
          RM/COBOL-85 Runtime System.  These problems include the
          possibility of having an OPEN statement open a different file
          than the one specified in the SELECT clause.




          Novell NETWARE 1.1

          On some early versions of network software, including Novell
          Netware 1.1.1, the RM/COBOL-85 I/O system fails when opening a
          file with a filename longer than eight characters or an extension
          longer than three characters.  If you encounter this problem use
          filenames of eight or fewer characters with extensions of three
          or fewer characters.  If a COBOL program specifies a file name
          with too many characters in the SELECT clause you can set an
          environment variable to override that name and avoid the problem
          without recompiling the program.




          PC-NFS

          In order for PC-NFS from Sun Microsystems to be able to properly
          apply region locks to files on a UNIX NFS server, version 3 or
          later of the "Network Lock Manager" program must be installed on
          all connected UNIX systems.  Failure to insure that all systems
          are current could prevent file and record locking from working or
          cause processes to "hang."  See the PC-NFS installation manual
          for directions on determining the version of the "Network Lock
          Manager" on your system.  If you need to upgrade Interactive UNIX
          System V.3.2/386, contact Interactive Systems and request updates
          SSU4.a and SSU4.b.




          SMARTDRV.EXE 4.0

          When loading SMARTDRV.EXE 4.0, provided with Microsoft Windows
          3.1, specify the undocumented /Y option to obtain correct
          RM/COBOL-85 behavior.  The default SMARTDRV 4.0 behavior is
          defective in ways which adversely affect the RM/COBOL-85 file
          system.  When a DOS Commit File Function is issued, SMARTDRV.EXE
          fails to clear the carry flag to indicate that the function
          succeeded, nor does it set the carry flag when the function
          failed.  This causes the RM/COBOL-85 file system to believe that
          the Commit File function is not supported and to revert to its
          pre-DOS 3.3 behavior of closing and reopening files in order to
          force data to disk.  This degrades performance and opens recovery
          windows that do not exist when the Commit File function is
          supported.  Specifying the /Y option fixes SMARTDRV's handling of
          the Commit File function.  Microsoft has said that this problem
          will be fixed in a future release.
