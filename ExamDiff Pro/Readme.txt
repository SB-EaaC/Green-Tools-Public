ExamDiff Pro(TM) Version 2.7
ExamDiff Pro Copyright 1997-2001 PrestoSoft(TM) ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

ExamDiff Pro is a shareware Windows 95/98/Me and Windows NT/2000 tool 
for visual file and directory comparison. It has a number of 
simple and convenient features that many users have been 
asking for a long time from a comparison tool.

Key features of ExamDiff Pro:

-Highlights file differences down to the level of lines, words or 
 characters.

-Allows editing files within file comparison panes.

-Prints and print previews diff reports.

-Allows creating directory snapshots for later comparison.

-Performs synchronous snd simple word wrapping of long lines.

-Remembers a user specified number of last compared first 
 and second files or directories.

-There is no need to specify both filenames -- just enter
 a directory name for one of the files to be compared. 
 EximDiff will attempt to use an entered filename with a 
 previously specified directory name for the second file.

-Toggles between the first and second files or directories.

-Automatically detects file or directory changes and prompts
 the user to re-compare.

-One push re-compare function attempts to leave the 
 viewer's focus in the same place as before the re-compare.

-Drag and drop support for dropping one or two files or
 directories into the program's window (e.g. from Windows
 Explorer) for comparison.

-Allows file or directory comparison from the directory
 comparison panes with a simple double-click on one of the
 files or directories to be compared.

-Allows the copying, renaming, and deleting files or
 directories from the directory comparison panes via menu,
 toolbar buttons, or a right button pop up. Any of these
 operations is followed by automatic re-synchronization of
 the compared directories. You can also sort directories 
 in the left or the right pane by name, size, type, or last
 modification time without losing synchronization.

-Easy editing of files. In addition to internal editing,
 ExamDiff Pro will spawn any editor (configurable by the user)
 with the file name and line number option (available for 
 editors that support this, through ExamDiff Pro variables:
 $FILE (first or second file name), $CURDIFF (number of line
 at which the current difference starts), $CARET (number of 
 line where the caret is located), and $COLUMN (number of 
 column where the caret is located)).

-Saves the differences in a file (standard UNIX DIFF file
 for file comparison).

-Easy navigation through the differences via "Next 
 Difference"/"Current Difference"/"Previous Difference" and
 "Go to Line" commands, and bookmarks.

-Allows the copying of text from the file comparison panes via 
 drag and drop, a hot key, or a right button pop up.

-Simple "Search" command to search for strings in the 
 comparison panes.

-Customizable text and background colors, font, tab size, 
 and "Show Differences Only" option as well as options to 
 "Ignore white spaces in lines", "Ignore changes in amount of 
 white spaces in lines", "Ignore case", "Treat files as text 
 files", "Ignore leading white space in lines" and 
 "Ignore trailing white space in lines" for comparison.

-Fully customizable file extension filter. For example, the 
 user can choose only .c and .cpp files or any other files 
 he/she chooses to be displayed.

-Tooltips which include file or directory properties (when
 the mouse cursor is placed over the pane title bars),
 difference number (when the cursor is over the yellow
 triangle marking the current difference), and etc.

-Adjustable pane splitter with smooth synchronized scrolling.
 Allows easy toggling between horizontal and vertical splitter 
 orientation as well as splitter centering and hiding of panes.

-Command line options include:
